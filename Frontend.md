**Objective:**

Your task is to develop a simple eCommerce web application with React.js and Redux for state management. The application will have functionalities like viewing product catalog, adding products to the cart, and checking out.

**Project Details:**

Product Catalog: The main page of the application should display a list of products. Each product will have the following attributes:

Name

Description

Price

Image

Product Detail Page: When a user clicks on a product, they should be taken to a product detail page where they can see more information about the product.

Shopping Cart: Users should be able to add products to a shopping cart. The cart should show the total price of all items in it. Users should also have the ability to remove items from the cart.

Checkout Page: Users should be able to proceed to a checkout page. On this page, users should be able to enter their shipping information and see the final price with shipping calculated in.

**Technical Requirements:**

The application must be built with React.js (preferably using functional components and hooks) and Redux for state management.

Use a fake REST API (like JSON Server) to simulate fetching data from the backend.

The application should be responsive and have a user-friendly UI. You can use a library like Bootstrap, Material-UI, or build your own CSS.

Code should be clean, well-commented, and follow best practices.

The application should handle errors gracefully. Users should be informed if something goes wrong.

**Bonus Points:**

Use React Router for navigation.

Add user authentication. Users should be able to register, login, and checkout only when they are logged in.

Add product search and filter functionality.

Write unit tests for your components using a library like Jest.

Deploy the application on a platform like Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku.

**Submission:**

Fork this GitHub repository and create a new branch for your code changes.
Implement the application according to the requirements listed above.
Submit a pull request to the main repository when you are finished.
Include a README file that explains how to set up and run the application locally.
Your code should be well-documented and include comments where necessary.
Don't submit zip files
Code should be hosted on your repo on GitHub/BitBucket or any other VCS platform

** In case of any ambiguity feel free to todo any assumption. But do state it in your README **
