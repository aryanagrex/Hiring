# Frontend Engineer Assignment: Sales Dashboard

## Description
Create a web application "Sales Dashboard" using ReactJS. This application should display sales data in the form of various charts and tables. The data can be hardcoded or loaded from a JSON file.

## Requirements

1. Use ReactJS for the frontend, Redux for state management, and React Router for navigation.
2. The dashboard should display the following components:
    - A line chart showing sales over time.
    - A bar chart comparing sales of different products.
    - A pie chart showing the percentage contribution of each product to total sales.
    - A table listing all sales records. Each record should include sale ID, product, quantity, and total price.
3. Implement filters that allow the user to view sales data for specific periods (e.g., last week, last month, last year) or specific products.
4. Use a charting library like Chart.js or D3.js for visualizing data.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Code quality:** Your code should be well-organized and maintainable. Follow best practices for React, Redux, and JavaScript.
- **Functionality:** Your application should meet all the requirements listed above.
- **Test Case:** Include unit test cases using Jest and React Testing Library.
- **User interface:** The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly. Use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling.
- **Error handling:** Your application should handle errors appropriately, including invalid form submissions and invalid filter inputs.

## Submission

1. Fork the provided GitHub repository and create a new branch for your code.
2. Implement the application according to the requirements.
3. Submit a pull request to the main repository when finished.
4. Include a README.md file that explains how to set up and run the application locally.
5. Your code should be well-documented and include comments where necessary.
6. Do not submit zip files. Code should be hosted on your GitHub/BitBucket or any other VCS platform.
7. **In case of any ambiguity, feel free to make assumptions, but remember to mention them in your README**.
